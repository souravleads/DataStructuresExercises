Queue:
LIFO
Last in first out
A list of collection with the restriction that insertion and deletion can be perform at single end.
Only removal possible on a top.
Example: discs in a peg, tennis balls in a cylindrical jar. (consider as a vertical queue)


operations:
Insertion:	Push(x)	-- InStrack
Deletion:	Pop()	-- DeStack
			Peek()	--To check the top element
IsEmpty()


Time complexity should be O(1)
